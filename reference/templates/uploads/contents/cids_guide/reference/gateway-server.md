# Gateway Integration

The CIDS gateway provides a web interface for browsing CIDS archives with automatic rendering and navigation.

## Gateway URL Pattern

```
/gateway/cids/{archive_CID}/{path}
```

The gateway transforms requests and responses to provide a rich browsing experience with markdown rendering, directory navigation, and URL rewriting.

For more details on the gateway implementation, see the gateway server documentation.
