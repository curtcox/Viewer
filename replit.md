# Overview

SecureApp is a Flask-based web application that demonstrates a multi-layered access control system. The application provides secure content access through user authentication, payment verification, and terms acceptance tracking. It features detailed HTTP request analysis as its core functionality, allowing authenticated and subscribed users to view comprehensive information about their web requests including headers, metadata, and network details.

# System Architecture

## Web Framework
The application is built on Flask with SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations. The architecture follows a traditional MVC pattern with clear separation of concerns:
- **Models**: User, Payment, and TermsAcceptance entities with relationships
- **Views**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5 for responsive UI
- **Controllers**: Route handlers managing authentication, payments, and content access

## Authentication & Authorization
Flask-Login provides session management with a multi-tier access control system:
- **Authentication**: Username/password login with session persistence
- **Payment Verification**: Subscription-based access with expiration tracking
- **Terms Acceptance**: Version-controlled terms that users must accept
- **Access Control**: Combined verification of all three factors before granting content access

## Database Design
SQLAlchemy with declarative base provides the ORM layer:
- **User Model**: Core user data with password hashing and access control methods
- **Payment Model**: Subscription tracking with plan types and expiration dates
- **Relationships**: One-to-many relationships with cascade delete for data integrity

## Form Handling
WTForms provides server-side validation with CSRF protection:
- **Custom Validators**: Username and email uniqueness validation
- **Security**: Password strength requirements and confirmation matching
- **User Experience**: Field-level error display with Bootstrap styling

## Frontend Architecture
Bootstrap 5 with custom CSS provides a responsive, accessible interface:
- **Component-Based**: Reusable card layouts and navigation components
- **Icon Integration**: Font Awesome icons for visual consistency
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with grid system

## Security Features
- **Password Security**: Werkzeug password hashing with salt
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with configurable secrets
- **Access Guards**: Decorator-based route protection with redirect handling
- **CSRF Protection**: Form token validation on all POST requests
