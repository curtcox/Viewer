# Template guidelines

These UI design principles keep the interface consistent and intuitive:

* If a UI element with text could be a link to something useful it should be, particularly when there is a single obvious destination. Make sure links are styled so they are clearly identifiable as links.
* Reserve buttons for actions that trigger changes. When the action only changes the current location without side effects, prefer a link over a button.

Refer back to the main project README for additional development guidance.
