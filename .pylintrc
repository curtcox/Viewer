    # Design choices - not bugs
    too-few-public-methods,      # R0903 - Data classes, forms, simple classes are fine
    too-many-instance-attributes, # R0902 - Some classes legitimately need many attrs
    too-many-arguments,           # R0913 - Sometimes necessary for complex functions
    too-many-locals,              # R0914 - Complex functions may need many variables
    too-many-branches,            # R0912 - Complex logic is sometimes unavoidable
    too-many-statements,          # R0915 - Long functions exist for good reasons
    too-many-return-statements,   # R0911 - Guard clauses with early returns are clear
    too-many-public-methods,      # R0904 - Test classes often have many methods
    
    # Documentation - optional for internal code

    # Import issues - environment specific
